This list includes drugs that may bind or otherwise interact with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been compiled from literature by members of the Paul Scherrer Institute.
For more information, contact [Xavier Deupi](mailto:xavier.deupi@psi.ch).

Drug candidates are not validated, and in many cases have not been peer reviewed.
Needless to say, this list is for research purposes only. It is not intended to
be used as a source for possible treatment options for patients.
